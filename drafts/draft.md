# Draft

<!-- The react code is processed in the build step, this means that the code we write will not be the code that ends up in the browser, we simply write code that is convenient for us the developer, then behind the scenes that code will be transformed before it reaches the browser.

`index.js` file is the starting point of the react application. In here, all the react code is imported. After which, the `render` method will insert all these code in a single html document right inside the `div` element with the `root` id, but only after the build step.

All the html elements that we use inside a react component, under the hood are built-in components as well, with additional functionalities such as `onClick` for event listening, and many more. But, the components that we create are not built-in, they are a different kind of component. -->
