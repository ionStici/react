# The Server-Client Boundary: Frontend vs Backend

- **Next.js with React Server Components (RSC):** Server components act as the backend, while client components represent the frontend. This unified approach allows developers to create full-stack applications within a single codebase, eliminating the need for a separate API layer.

- **Handling Data Mutations:** Server Actions enable direct data manipulation on the server from client components. This approach replaces traditional POST and PUT requests to a backend API, streamlining the data mutation process.

## Importing vs. Rendering in Next.js with RSC

### Server Components

Server components can import and render both client and server components.

### Client Components

Client components can import and render other client components.

Client components can render server components, but instead of importing them, the server components needs to be passed as props to client components, such as `children`.

This is possible because at the point where the server component instance is passed as a prop, the server component has already been imported at the top of the file and executed on the server.

### Dependency Tree

**Dependency Tree:** The structure of how modules are imported into other modules. In the React Server Components (RSC) model, server modules are imported at the top so that they could be passed as props to client components. The client-server boundary is determined by this dependency tree, not the component tree. Therefore, client components cannot import server components directly; they can only import other client components. However, client components can render server components if they receive them as props. This rendering works because both component types are already imported at the top.

### Consideration

**Note:** If a client component imports and renders a server component (no `'use client'` directive), then the server component will be treated as a client component. Otherwise, the server component remains a server component.

To optimize rendering, it's best to keep client components as deep in the component tree as possible. This practice ensures that only the necessary components are treated as client components, allowing other components to be server-rendered when appropriate. This approach helps in maintaining server-side rendering benefits and minimizing the client-side JavaScript load.
