# React Ecosystem

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. While React excels at creating UI components, it does not include built-in solutions for aspects like routing, styling, or making HTTP requests. To handle these, we rely on third-party libraries. Fortunately, React boasts a large ecosystem of libraries to meet these needs.

Next.js, Remix, Gatsby are "opinionated" React frameworks built on top of React, they extend React's functionalities, providing solutions for routing, state management, styling, and more.

These frameworks can be seen as full-stack solutions because they offer features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), all while using React as the core foundation.

**Routing:** `React Router`

**Client State Management:** `useState` `useReducer` `Context API`

**Server State Management:** `React Query` `fetch()` `Axios`
