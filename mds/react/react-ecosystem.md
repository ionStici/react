# React Ecosystem

**Framework:** (all-in-one kit) everything you need to build a complete app is included.

React is a view **library** (not a framework). If you want to build large-scale SPAs, you will need to include many 3rd-party external libraries for things like routing, styling, http requests, and so on, because all these functionalities are not part of React itself.

React has a large ecosystem of libraries that we can use in our projects.

- Routing: **React Router**, React Location
- Client State Management: **Context API**, **Redux**, Zustand
- Server State Management: **React Query**, SWE, Apollo
- Form Handling: **React Hook Form**, Formik
- Styling: **CSS Modules, Styled Components, TailwindCSS**
- Animation: Framer Motion, React Spring
- UI Components: Material-UI, Chakra UI, Mantine, Ant Design, Headless UI, DaisyUI
- HTTP Requests: fetch(), Axios

Next.js, Remix, Gatsby are "opinionated" React frameworks built on top of React, they extend React's functionalities, providing solutions for routing, state management, styling, and more.

We can consider these React frameworks as full-stack frameworks because they provide features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static-side generation (SSG), all by using React as the base layer.
