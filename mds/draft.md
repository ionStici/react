# Supabase

[Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is a service that allows developers to easily **create a backend with a Postgres database.**

It automatically creates a **database** and **API** so we can easily request and receive data from the server.

No backend development needed. Additionally, supabase comes with easy-to-use **user authentication** and **file storage**.
