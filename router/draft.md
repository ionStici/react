## Storing State in the URL

The URL is an excellent place to store UI state and an alternative to `useState` in some situations. Examples: open/closed panels, currently selected list item, list sorting order, applied list filters.

1. Easy way to store state in a **global place**, accessible to **all components** in the app
2. Good way to **"pass" data** from one page into the next page
3. Makes it possible to **bookmark and share** the page with the exact UI state it had at the time

## Dynamic Routes With URL Parameters

## Programmatic Navigation with useNavigate
